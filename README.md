# 'Green Wave' concept app

\****work in progress***\*

Implementation of one of the concepts of smart city. The system tracks emergency transport, such as an ambulance, casting a 'green wave' of traffic lights for them to get to the desination without any obstructions like traffic jams.

Tracking (or telemetry collection, whatever) is done via MQTT protocol, with the help of Google\`s Cloud Platform (IoT, Functions, Pub/Sub) and Firebase\`s Realtime Database.
